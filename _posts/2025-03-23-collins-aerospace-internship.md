Iâ€™m thrilled to announce that I will be joining Collins Aerospace as a Software Engineering Intern with the Vision and Sensor Systems (VSS) team!

I can't wait to dive into this opportunity to contribute to the aerospace industry, develop valuable skills, and expand my professional network. A huge thank you to my manager and recruiter at Collins Aerospace, as well as the MECOP program, for making this possible, and to my friends and family for their support throughout this journey.
