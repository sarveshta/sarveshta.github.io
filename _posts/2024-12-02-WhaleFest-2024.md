Last month, I participated in [WhaleFest’24](https://sitkawhalefest.org/) in Sitka, Alaska. It was an eye-opening and rewarding experience!

My colleague, Casey, and I presented our research project, [WeatherChimes](https://www.hardware-x.com/article/S2468-0672(23)00009-3/fulltext) - an IoT microcontroller package that collects environmental and climate data - at the WhaleFest Science Symposium. I interacted with many community members, researchers, and high school students to share this exciting technology.

I also assisted Dr. Chet Udell with a workshop exploring how to perform sonification on environmental data, transforming it into sound to uncover patterns and correlations. Hearing data come to life was a transformative experience for everyone involved. 

I am grateful to [Dr. Chet Udell](https://www.chetudell.com/) and the [OPEnS Lab](https://open-sensing.org/) at Oregon State University, which makes opportunities like this possible.
