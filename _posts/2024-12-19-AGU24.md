Last week, I was privileged to attend the [AGU 2024](https://www.agu.org/annual-meeting) Conference in Washington, D.C., where I represented OPEnS Lab and showcased WeatherChimes, an IoT weather station that supports Indigenous communities in Alaska with stream health monitoring and assists geohydrologists with landslide analysis and modeling. 

In addition to presenting this work, I staffed the OPEnS booth. I interacted with numerous scientists and researchers to discuss how our lab’s expertise can support their projects' technological needs. I also met engineers working on many of the technologies we rely on to learn about the engineering processes behind the sensors we use. 

This experience helped me gain valuable insights from other researchers working on similar projects, including how they tackled challenges we’ve faced in our research. It also deepened my appreciation for computer engineering's versatility and unexpected applications in fields like geohydrology. They showed me how far the discipline extends beyond what I initially imagined.

This experience was inspiring, and I’m grateful to [Dr. John Selker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-selker-988b652b/), [Dr. Chet Udell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-chet-udell-a3786b18/), and the [OPEnS Lab](https://open-sensing.org/) at Oregon State University for this incredible opportunity to contribute to this field, help develop my skills, and grow as a person!
