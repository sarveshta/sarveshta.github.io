I'm excited to share that my team won 1st place in a competitive hackathon‚Äîour 4th consecutive win! üèÜ

We built [GetTheDamClass](https://beav.es/GetTheDamClass), a Chrome extension that notifies OSU students when spots open up in their desired classes (during phase one registration). With 30+ users, it has helped many register for their classes this term despite its release towards the end of the registration season!

I learned a lot about industry tools and technologies and deploying apps for the public. My contributions included:
Planning the backend API and database
Deploying Docker containers
Configuring a VPS and setting up Nginx web server
Configuring Cloudflare and our Domain
Coding a Python interface to connect the web app to MySQL
Implementing authentication with hashing and salting 

All this in less than 48 hours!

This journey has been an incredible opportunity to learn, collaborate, and impact the OSU community! Special thanks to [Ajinkya Gokule](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajinkyagokule/), [Colin Pannikkat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colinpannikkat/), and [David Gesl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gesl/) for being amazing teammates!
