Grew up in India, Malaysia, US and now studying Electrical and Computer Engineering at Oregon State University. I'm passionate about aviation and robotics and enjoy tinkering with electronics and working on coding projects.

Currently, I work part-time as an Electrical and Programming Specialist for OPEnS Lab's WeatherChime project where we develop environmental sensing devices used for commercial and research purposes in local and indigenous communities.
